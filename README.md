Robotics! 
There are 8 branches in this repository and each branch is named after it's purpose and subject.
In the branch you can see code files and also simulink models if needed, codes may present a function or a script which is developed based on a question.
Questions are in a PDF file located in each branch.
I hope this would be useful for you.
